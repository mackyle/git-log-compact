git-log-compact
===============

A compact alternative to `git log --oneline` that includes dates, times
and author and/or committer initials in a space efficient output format.

The `git-log-compact` script is intended to fill the gap between the
`--oneline` log output format and the `--pretty=short`/`--pretty=medium`
output formats.  It is not strictly a one line per commit output format
(but almost) and while it only shows the title of each commit (like the
`--pretty=short` format) it does include author and date information
(like the `--pretty=medium` format) except that timestamps are shown
very compactly and author/committer names are shown as initials.

This allows one to get a complete view of repository activity in a very
compact output format that can show many commits per screen full and is
fully compatible with the `--graph` option.

The `--notes`, `--pretty` and `--format` options are not allowed but any
other `git log` options should work fine (especially `--graph`).

In both `--graph` and non `--graph` modes:

   * Root commits are identified by `_` on either side of the hash

When `--graph` mode is enabled, the graph output is enhanced as follows:

   * Breaks are inserted when necessary to avoid parent/child ambiguity


Installation
------------

Put the `git-log-compact` executable file in one of the directories
included in the `PATH` environment variable.

Optionally set a global alias to save typing such as `lc` like so:

    git config --global alias.lc log-compact

Optionally set global default options such as `--two-initials` and
`--abbrev=8` like so:

    git config --global log-compact.defaults "--two-initials --abbrev=8"


Dates & Times
-------------

Dates and times are shown in the local timezone.  Set the TZ variable
before running `git log-compact` (e.g. `TZ=UTC git log-compact` to show
dates and times in UTC) or use the `--time-zone=` option (e.g.
`git log-compact --time-zone=UTC`) to change that.

Dates are shown on a date line all by themselves like so:

    === 2015-11-13 ===

The date line indicates that the times on all the following lines
(regardless of whether or not `--reverse` is being used) up until
the next date line take place on the indicated date.  For example
this output:

    === 2015-09-28 ===
    be08dee9 13:18 jc (tag: v2.6.0) Git 2.6
    === 2015-09-21 ===
    8d530c4d 13:26 jc (tag: v2.6.0-rc3) Git 2.6-rc3

    5fc31c1f 09:44 tq l10n: Update and review Vietnamese translation

shows one commit on 2015-09-28, two commits on 2015-09-21 and three
commits on 2015-09-20.

Note that a date line may appear more than once for the same date
(this is especially common when using `--graph` with its default
`--topo-order`).

The purpose of a date line is to indicate what date has been elided
from the following lines, nothing more.


Examples
--------

For example, running `git log-compact --decorate --graph -n 17 v2.6.1`
on the Git repository produces this output (which will be colorized
on the terminal if color is enabled):

      === 2015-09-28 ===

The output will be colorized according to the same settings used to enable/
disable color for git log output.

Additionally, the color of the three new items (dates, times and
initials) can be controlled with the `color.log-compact.date`,
`color.log-compact.time` and `color.log-compact.initials` config options.

Running `git log-compact --graph --max-parents=0` on the Git repository gives:

      === 2009-04-24 ===
    *_0ca71b37_11:13 ap  basic options parsing and whatnot.

Notice the `_` on either side of the hash identifying those commits
as root commits.  The `_` will only appear on the left side of the
hash if the selected output format would have normally included a
space there.  In `--graph` mode, all the spaces between the commit mark
(e.g. `*`) and the hash are turned into `_`.

Running `git log-compact --decorate --graph --no-merges -n 13 v2.6.1`
on the Git repository results in this output:

      === 2015-09-28 ===
    * 22f698cb 19:19 jch (tag: v2.6.1) Git 2.6.1

Notice how four linear breaks (`..........`) were automatically
inserted to avoid parent child relationship confusion.

In non `--graph` mode, linear breaks are NOT automatically inserted.
They must be requested with the usual `--show-linear-break` option.


Options
-------

In addition to allowing all the normal `git log` options except for
`--notes`, `--format` and `--pretty` (`--oneline` is allowed and
silently ignored), the following additional options may be utilized:

   * `--seconds`  
     include seconds in the time (i.e. HH:MM:SS instead of just HH:MM)

   * `--minutes`  
     include minutes but not seconds in the time (i.e. HH:MM not HH:MM:SS)  
     This is the default

   * `--no-times`  
     omit the time field entirely

   * `--two-initials`  
     only show at most two initials instead of the usual three  
     This is the default if `--initials=author,committer` or
     `--initials=committer,author` is used.

   * `--three-initials`  
     show at most three initials  
     This is the default unless `--initials=author,committer` or
     `--initials=committer,author` is used.

   * `--no-initials`  
     omit the initials field entirely

   * `--commit-message`  
     when using `--walk-reflogs` show commit message not reflog message

   * `--author-date`  
     force use of author dates and times  
     The default is to use committer dates and times unless
     `--author-date-order` is in effect.  This option forces author
     dates and times to always be used and overrides `--committer-date`.

   * `--committer-date`  
     force use of committer dates and times  
     The default is to use committer dates and times if `--date-order` or
     `--topo-order` is in effect or `--author-date-order` is NOT in effect.
     This option forces committer dates and times to always be used and
     overrides a previous `--author-date` option.

   * `--initials=author`  
     show author initials  
     This is the default behavior

   * `--initials=committer`  
     show committer initials instead of author initials

   * `--initials=author,committer`  
     show author and commiter initials separated by a `/`  
     This changes the initials width default from three to two.

   * `--initials=committer,author`  
     show commiter and author initials separated by a `/`  
     This changes the initials width default from three to two.

   * `--time-zone=zone`  
     set the TZ environment variable to `zone`  
     This is an alterative to setting TZ before running `git log-compact`
     and will affect the time zone dates and times are displayed in.

   * `--weekday`  
     show the weekday with the date

   * `--no-weekday`  
     do not show the weekday with the date  
     This is the default behavior

In addition to the above options, color output is controlled as normal
for `git log` with the addition of `color.log-compact.date`,
`color.log-compact.time` and `color.log-compact.initials` config options
to alter the default colors for dates, times and initials respectively.

Furthermore, default options may be set in the `log-compact.defaults`
config value and they will be treated as though they appeared at
the very beginning of the `git log-compact` command line option list
(e.g. `git config log-compact.defaults "--abbrev=8 --seconds"`).
